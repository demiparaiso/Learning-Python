Python learning dump

I realized I learn coding best by actually coding and following codes from other notebooks. I've been learning recently about pandas, and numpy, and seaborn. I hope to learn more and code more in the coming days. 

My plan is to go through this https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-Jupyter-Notebooks.
